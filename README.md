# Jupyter_UNIX
In this repository I will explain to you why Jupyter Notebook is so useful and why is one of my daily tools analyzing data.

You might find two files with the same information but with different extensions.
 If you seek to run the code in Jupyter Notebook, I suggest you open the .ipynb file.
 Otherwise, if you only want to take a look at how Jupyter Notebook looks like without installing it, I suggest you open de .html file.
